# CoolDwarf

CoolDwarf is a dynamic brown dwarf cooling model meant to cover short time scales with high accuracy. That is to say 
that CoolDwarf is not meant to trace cooling over gigayear, megayear, or even kiloyear timescales; rather, CoolDwarf is meant
to trace cooling over minutes, hours, days, and year timescales. 

The original reason for this project was to model the surface temperature profile of a brown dwarf + Mdwarf binary where
the M dwarf exhibits a high degree of XRay flux (from flares).


## CoolDwarf is still *very* early in its development and should not be taken as a scientificly useful software yet!

Development is ongoing and I hope to have a realease within the next 6 months.
